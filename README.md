    A Discord music bot focused on performance, without neglecting good audio quality and extensive features.

## Features

* Celerity is **simple to use**! Uses only text commands, no complicated slashes needed. Fully documented within the bot
  itself. You can most likely master Celerity's usage if you have more than 1 IQ.
* Celerity is **fast**! Written in TypeScript with a local Lavalink server to handle requests. The only thing that drags
  Celerity down is its ping to Discord's API servers.
* Celerity is **customisable**! Set custom prefixes for your server, enable or disable embeds and emojis, have the bot
  delete its own messages, set a DJ role and much more!
* Celerity is **free**! No paywalls, premium services or vote-locked commands. Everything that would be paid on other
  bots, free on Celerity. For example, the `volume` command.
* Celerity is **stable**! TypeScript is a type-safe language, making most errors within the code detectable during
  development. Any errors the bot encounters can most likely not be attributed to its code.

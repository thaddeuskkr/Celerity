# Celerity is being discontinued

## Why?

Celerity is one of the projects I've worked the longest on. The first commit to this repository was on 8/5/2023, and I've continued to maintain Celerity since then (with some breaks in-between). 
Celerity has been incredibly stable, with the longest uptime being over 1 month - with no major issues. However, it's impossibly difficult to gain traction especially with the lack of financial power I have. 
As of 9/9/2024, Celerity is in 55 servers - not even close to bot verification. Of course, Celerity isn't the best music bot - but from my experience using it, it has been one of the better ones out there. 
Considering this bot hasn't been growing much and has seen a decline in users, I am discontinuing the development of Celerity. I haven't been keeping up with Discord's API updates lately either, so I think this is for the better.  

### *The public instance of Celerity will be shut down on the 11th of September, 2024.*

## What's next?

Nothing. This code is published for all to use. Celerity is free for you to maintain if you'd like to do so, but if not, there are a plethora of music bots out there that can do the same things that Celerity can.
